# Setup and Training

The first step is to install necessary dependencies and setup my environment.
In my case the fastai toolbox as well as a search engine API.
In chapter 2, bing search was the one used. Alas, that got deprecated in the meantime, so I am going to use duckduckgo search another free search API.


```python
# Clean up previous folders
!rm -rf animal

# Install latest fastai + fastcore + fastbook
!pip install -U fastai fastcore fastbook ddgs

import fastbook
fastbook.setup_book()
```

```python
from fastbook import *
from fastai.vision.widgets import *
from ddgs import DDGS
import time, random
from pathlib import Path

# 1. Collect data
animals = ["cat", "dog"]
path = Path('animals')  # Path to store images

if not path.exists():
    path.mkdir()

for animal in animals:
    dest = (path/animal)
    dest.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    with DDGS() as ddg:
        results = [r for r in ddg.images(f'{animal}', max_results=100)]  # Search for cat or dog images
        # Extract content URLs from the result dictionaries
        urls = [r.get('image') or r.get('contentUrl') for r in results if r.get('image') or r.get('contentUrl')]
        # Random delay to avoid spamming the server
        time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))
        # Download the images
        download_images(dest, urls=urls)
```


```python
# List results
fns = get_image_files(path)
print(len(fns))
```

    184
    

Now that the process of collecting data is over, we need to check if any are corrupted. By corrupted, we usually refer to files that return an error when trying to open them.
An image or file is corrupted when:
* Downloaded incompletly
* Subject to network tranmission errors
* Storage or memory issues
* File-system or server-side problems  and if that's the case clean them.

To check for integrity, we use the `verify_images` function.
This will return a collection object that has a `map` method which calls the passed function onto each element of the collection.
In this case it's the `unlink` function that will handle the cleaning of corrupted files.


```python
failed = verify_images(fns)
print(failed)
failed.map(Path.unlink);
```

    /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/PIL/Image.py:3570: UserWarning: image file could not be identified because AVIF support not installed

Now that we have our dataset, it's time to split it into `train`, `validation` and `test` sets.
* Training Set: Used to teach the model.

* Validation Set: Used during development to tune model settings (hyperparameters) and check generalization.

* Test Set: Used only at the end to fairly evaluate final model performance on unseen data.

Without separate sets, the model (or developers) might overfit—performing well on known data but poorly on new data.
The test set ensures honest, unbiased evaluation and helps prevent self-deception or vendor manipulation.

Keep in mind that data is usually biased, and if that's not taken into consideration, your model will end up equally biased.

To achieve that we use a `DataLoader` on each set and a thin super class `DataLoaders` to combine them all.


```python
# 3. Define the DataBlock
catVsDog = DataBlock(
    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),                 # Image = input, Category = output

There is clearly an image where I have both animals but labelled as `cat` so I choose `<Delete>`.
As for the small doggo being mistaken for a cat, work hazard I suppose.

# Turning the Model into a Web Application

Once the model fine tuned, it's time to save it so it can be used in production.


```python
learn.export("CatVsDog.pkl")
```


```python
# Make sure the model is correctly saved
path = Path()
path.ls(file_exts='.pkl')
```




    (#1) [Path('CatVsDog.pkl')]



Time to use this inference learned in a web application.
For that I opted for gradio for fast showcasing.
In the book, however they used [voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) along with jupyter notebook for deployment.


```python
!pip install gradio
```


```python
import gradio as gr
from fastai.vision.all import *

# Load your model
learn = load_learner('export.pkl')  # Your Fastai model

# Define prediction function
def predict(img):
    _, _, probs = learn.predict(img)
    return {learn.dls.vocab[i]: float(probs[i]) for i in range(len(probs))}

# Build interface
interface = gr.Interface(fn=predict, inputs=gr.Image(type="pil"), outputs=gr.Label())
interface.launch()

```


# Notes on Development & Deployment

While working on this first post, I encountered and resolved several challenges worth documenting.

Initially, all development—including model training and testing—was done in a Google Colab notebook. I wanted to preserve the cell outputs from that session to accurately reflect the training process in the final blog post. This meant converting the Colab notebook into a Quarto .qmd file without re-executing the code during rendering, so outputs would remain intact.

To prevent code re-execution, I added the following to both the YAML header of the .qmd file and the global Quarto configuration:

```{yml}
title: Title
jupyter: python3
execute:
  freeze: true
```

However, using `quarto convert my-notebook.ipynb` didn’t preserve the output cells as expected.
A reliable workaround was to first convert the notebook to Markdown:

```shell
jupyter nbconvert my-notebook.ipynb --to markdown --output converted-notebook.qmd
```

Then, I renamed the file to `.qmd` and manually added the necessary YAML header.

Another issue arose when I attempted to run the exported model on my local Windows machine. Since the model was trained in a Unix environment, it used `PosixPath` internally (via `pathlib`), which led to this error on Windows:

```sh
NotImplementedError: cannot instantiate 'PosixPath' on your system
```
To resolve this, I patched `PosixPath` to `WindowsPath` during model loading:

```{python}
import platform
from pathlib import Path
if platform.system() == 'Windows':
    import pathlib
    pathlib.PosixPath = pathlib.WindowsPath
```

Lastly, for consistent predictions, ensure your local environment mirrors the dependency versions used during model training—particularly for `fastai`, `torch`, and `torchvision`.
