# 👋 Welcome!

Hi and thank you for taking interest in my blog (Although for now it's just a draft for myself).

This site started as my notebook for the [Fastai Practical Deep Learning Course](https://course.fast.ai/), but it will grow into a collection of learnings, experiments, and web apps across different domains.

Hope you enjoy!
