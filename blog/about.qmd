# ðŸ‘¤ About Me

I'm an Algorithms Engineer with nearly three years of experience at a small French company, where I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from low-level embedded systems to high-level algorithm design.

My responsibilities have included:
- Developing and deploying a regression testing tool to evaluate the quality of internal navigation solutions
- Implementing novel INS/GNSS fusion algorithms for robust positioning
- Refactoring and enhancing a C++ codebase used in both embedded and post-processing systems

Although my background isn't directly in AI, I've always followed the field with curiosity and admiration. I did have an early exposure to neural networks during a research internship, where I worked on depth estimation using deep learning â€” but that was a few years ago.

Fast-forward three years, and I realized how much the field has progressed â€” and how much I wanted to catch up. After asking ChatGPT (naturally) how best to dive back in, I found myself enrolled in the excellent [Fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course.

This blog is a way for me to document that journey publicly â€” a mix of notes, experiments, and web apps â€” while I continue to re-enter and grow in the world of modern machine learning.
